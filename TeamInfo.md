## Project Summary

 This project analyzes the relationship between natural disasters and economic indicators. The platform we intend to create will allow its users to explore how various types of disasters affect economic factors such as GDP, inflation, unemployment, education, and housing prices over time. Our web-based platform will allow users to visualize and compare economic impacts of disasters using data visualizations, historical trends, and predictive analytics. By leveraging real-world data sources, this platform will give policymakers, researchers, and other curious parties insight into the connection between natural disasters and economic trends, helping inform disaster preparedness and recovery strategies!!!!
